# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview Of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to "organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful".

## Analysis and Challenges

### In order to arrived at our conclusion we separated the data we would be analysing, Successful, failed and cancelled campaings. we use "powerful tools such as vlookup to find the data needed. We also used graphs and pivot tables to find the information to get a better visual of the data. The most significant challenge I encounter was using the countifs fuction. This was because I had a misunderstand about the use of filters. I thought that when a drop down filter was use that this would alter the data. I was able to overcome this challenge by the help of a college that help me understand what was actully happening and how to properly insurt a filter on the countifs function. The line graphs shoes a spike on the number of successful campaing on those months. Number Two, The month of May is the top month to run the campaing, after that there is a continual decline all the way until December.

## Two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date

### A conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date I that the months March and May are the best months to launch a campaing. For a visual aspect please see the line graph below.

## Outcomes Based on Goals

### By looking at the Line Graph, I conclude That the Outcomes based on Goals that there is an opposite yet reciprocal corolation between the number of sucessful and failed campaings. There is also no data on the cancelled campaings so I cannnot say anything on it. Also There are three points where failed and cancelled are the same between 40% to 60% of the campaings.For a visual aspect please see the line graph below.

## Limitations of Dataset

### Some limitations of this dataset are that it does not give the testimony of the people that already did the campaings in the past. Even though the dataset does a good job at presentig the data real life experience can help Louise go even further in making her project campaign successful

## Tables/Graphs that we could create for a Future Project

### Another Chart that we could have use to help Loise was histogram chart combine with a line graph to get a better visual, or we could have also use a pie graph. Although I believe that the graphs we used does a good job in showing Louise what she needs from the dataset.
